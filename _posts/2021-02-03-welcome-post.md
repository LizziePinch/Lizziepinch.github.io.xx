# Welcome!

Hello! Welcome to my website, where you will find nearly everything, such as my writing, drawing, photos, opinions and more! You may notice some of my writing is quite silly, but in a good way, and so are m my drawings, but that doesn’t matter.

Firstly, let me tell you a little bit about me. I am 11 years old and I enjoy reading, writing, drawing and playing video games. I have a hamster called Peanut and a younger brother who is 9 and likes The Mandalorian. My favourite colour is pink, my favourite animal is, well, I don’t really have one, because they’re all great, but I don’t really like spiders. My favourite video game is called Stardew Valley, and my favourite programme is Horrible Histories. I am looking forward to writing new posts and sharing my creativity, and I hope you enjoy reading them!
